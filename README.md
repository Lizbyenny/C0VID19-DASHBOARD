COVID19 PANDEMIC HIGHLIGHTS

PROJECT OBJECTIVE:
COVID19 also known as Corona Virus as been in existence since 2020 and its has since then spur on widespread fear and paranoia because it is highly contagious. This pandemic is felt across the world in the Economic System, Health System, Educational Sector and our way of life generally.  However, the purpose of this project is to show a data driven decision on the growth or increase from the reported cases of sum of confirmed, sum of deaths and rate.

PROJECT SOURCING:
The COVID19 Data used for this project is gotten from the repository of githup: https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/tree/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series 

DATA TRANSFORMATION:
I got the data from a web source and uploaded it on the Microsoft Excel, I transformed the data and it took me to power query editor, where I started by changing the first row to header, highlighted the first four columns and unpivoted the other columns to reduce the columns against the rows, I furthered by changing the name on the columns, merging the three queries (confirmed cases, deaths and recovered cases) into one query, I corrected the data type for the date, confirmed, deaths and recovered columns then I close and load the data to excel.
After loading the data to excel, I created three other columns for Month, Day and Year and extracted the value for each from the date column respectively. 
I opened a new sheet for analysis, where I made about six pivot tables for the data showing the top and bottom 5 countries with the highest and the lowest prevalence of COVID19 Cases, total sum of confirmed cases, total death cases, total death rate and also the total confirmed cases by years and months.

DATA VISUALIZATION:
The dashboard is created in excel to give insight on the widespread of the virus across the globe with the aid of the graphical representation.
